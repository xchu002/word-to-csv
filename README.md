# word-to-csv
This is a program that can transfer the contents of many word documents at once into a csv file with two columns: the  Document Name and the Content.  

Usage: Download wordToCSV.py and put it in the same folder as the docx files. Run this file using vscode/spyder or any code editor you wish. 
There should be a file named output.csv created in the same folder, which contains the output.

The songs.py file is just a customised version of wordToCSV.py for the song lyrics project.
